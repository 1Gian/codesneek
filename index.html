				<h3 bold>VPS Hosting</h3>

				<p>The rate at which the internet is expanding is fascinating, and we can see all types of new websites and services coming up online. All these websites together make the whole internet that we all are so fond of nowadays.

We can’t do a single task without the internet in today’s time. It doesn’t matter if you are a youngster or an elder; the internet has got each and every one of us hooked, and we love browsing social networking websites, chatrooms, image boards, etc.<br> 
In order to host websites online, businesses and individuals need a hosting space. There are all kinds of hosting options available. You can choose from shared hosting and dedicated hosting. Nevertheless there is one more category of hosting that you can choose from, and that is called VPS hosting.<br></p>

<h5>What is VPS Hosting?</h5>

<p>
VPS hosting stands for Virtual Private Server. Which means that the virtualized server’s resources are totally at your disposal and use, unlike shared hosting in which you had to share the resources with other people on the shared server.

Keep in mind that VPS is different from a dedicated server as it is developed under system virtualization. System virtualization means that the server has many virtual machines running on it and the system resources which mean the RAM, CPU, disk storage has been partitioned between these virtual machines.

Why do you need it?

If you have a website with high traffic and the shared servers are not able to manage that kind of traffic, your best bet is now on VPS servers. VPS servers not only come cheap, but they can also handle a decent amount of traffic.

You don’t have to shell out hundreds of dollars a month in order to get a stable, dedicated server when you can get a VPS server at a much lower cost. You get full resources to your disposal, so that is great as well.

Now that we know about VPS servers and how they work and why you need them, I will tell you a thing or two about Host1Plus as this is a Host1Plus VPS Hosting review.

		     <h3> Can Computer Programming Boost Your Brain Power?</h3>
                <img src="img/portfolio/2.jpg" alt="img2" />
                <p>Learning how to program for the first time was a challenge for Adam Waxman.

He worked as a full-time investment banking analyst in Atlanta, but in January 2013, his nights were less about reclining after a day’s work and more about teaching himself Objective-C and JavaScript with books and online tutorials.

Your brain on computersBy that summer, he left his career in finance behind and moved to New York to enroll in a programming boot camp where he learned Ruby on Rails.

“It’s like learning a foreign language,” says Waxman, 25, a product developer at SeatGeek, a New York ticketing start-up. “It’s much easier to learn a programming language by being very immersive.”

Careers in code and programming are no doubt booming. But are there less-visible benefits? Can a career in software and web development keep you healthy and fit, particularly your brain? Besides agile software development methods, meet-up groups and collaborative projects — which help foster social interactions — programming involves creativity, critical thinking and algorithmic skills necessary to complete tasks.

“When people say they want to learn to program, what they’re really saying is, ‘I want to solve a problem that the computer can help you with,’ ” says Sherif Abushadi, an educator at Dev Bootcamp, who has nearly 13 years of experience teaching development. “In fact, most programmers spend half their time failing over and over and fixing those mistakes until they get it right.” </p>
